# Hangman

Simple command line game to help me practice python

To play simply run hangman.py (python hangman.py) and choose a file with possible words for the game.
I use sowpods (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmlewis/valett/master/scrabble/sowpods.txt)
but any list with one word per row would work.
A random word from the list will be chosen and you can start guessing the letters.


Options

Instead of picking a letter, the following keywords can also be used:

help
	Shows game instructions and these options

exit
	Ends the game

newgame
	Starts a new game
	Picks a new word and resets the mistake count
